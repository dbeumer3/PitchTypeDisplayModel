This work was done at the end of the 2023-2024 college baseball season, as the intent was for this work to be used in an application meant to display all pitchers in NCAA baseball. Specifically, this work was used to assess pitchers in the transfer portal by accurately and efficiently determining the pitch types they throw.

The Pitch Type Display Function is a function that can be applied to any cleaned dataset that is designed to show a pitcher's pitch types when their pitches are displayed in an application. This was run on a dataset containing games across all of NCAA baseball. The goal was to determine which pitch types a pitcher actually throws, as many pitchers in the data have falsely tagged pitches that result in arsenals of 6-7 pitches when in reality it should be far less. This reduces that number to the actual amount of pitches a pitcher throws primarily based on pitch movement. The reduced arsenals assist coaches, players, and other staff have a correct understanding of pitchers' arsenals and how to prepare for them or talk with them.
